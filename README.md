Intro
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Artemis is a high performance Entity System framework for games, originally written in Java, and is a framework to manage entities in a game world. Although Artemax is currently being used in games in development it is still considered experimental. Use in your projects at your own risk.

Artemax has no code dependencies. It can be used in any Blitzmax framework without problems, provided the necessary systems are created.

There is a very good explanation of the framework on the [Artemis site](http://gamadu.com/artemis/manual.html).
